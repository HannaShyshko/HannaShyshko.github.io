TRAVEL

The idea of the cite is to provide some information about the countries and to make it real for travel lovers to realize their dreams to visit a favorite country.

The main page consists of:
- the navigation menu across the cite;
- a slide show;
- and the block of continents to observe

When the user clicks one of the blocks, he\she is redirected to the Tours page.

The Tours page consists of the blocks of countries. When the user hovers the block -> its opacity transforms from 0.6 to 1 which helps to highlight the country. The user can also learn more about the country by clicking the link in the bottom of the country block.

The Contacts page consists of two parts:

- The form (to receive the user's information)
- The contacts of the travel agency

The form consists of several inputs, some of them are necessary to fill in. The inputs also have the 'placeholder' attribute to help the user fill in the correct information. 

The cite is adaptive to the desktops and mobile phones.
